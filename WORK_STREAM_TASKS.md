This document tracks tasks across multiple work streams (branches) for this project. It serves as the single source of truth for project status and planning.

> For detailed process guidelines, refer to [requirements/work_stream_management.md](requirements/work_stream_management.md)

## Initial Bootstrap Tasks

These tasks must be completed before any branch-specific work can begin.

- [ ] **Bootstrap repository initialization** (Critical Priority)
  - [ ] Verify if repository needs initialization with `git status` (will show error if not a repo)
  - [ ] If not initialized, Claude should run bootstrap scripts in sequence:
    1. Setup local Git with inception commit: `./setup_local_git_inception.sh <repo-name>`
    2. Create GitHub repository: `./create_github_remote.sh <repo-name>` (defaults to public, use `private` option if needed)
    3. Install bootstrap templates: `./install_bootstrap_templates.sh <repo-name>`
  - [ ] After scripts complete, verify repository creation with `git status` and `git log`
  - [ ] Verify branch structure with `git branch --all`
  - [ ] Confirm bootstrap directories exist: requirements/, templates/, context/, etc.
  - [ ] Proceed to branch-specific tasks below based on current branch

After bootstrap is complete, Claude should identify the current branch and follow the appropriate tasks for that work stream.

## All work stream branches 

- **Continuous Improvement Tasks** (always in progress, recurring with each update)
  - In the current branch's core documents search for `(#TBRW)` tags, these are headers, sentences or paragraphs that need a first pass of cleanup, or possibly refactoring into more appropriate places, given the context of the current branch's files.

## Branch: [main]

Main branch tasks for project initialization and ongoing core infrastructure.

**Core Documents:**
- [WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md]
- [context/main-CONTEXT.md]

**Related Requirements:**
- [requirements/branch_management.md](requirements/branch_management.md)
- [requirements/pr_process.md](requirements/pr_process.md)
- Links to additioal primary requirements documents once created

**Continuous Improvement Tasks** (always in progress, recurring with each update)

- **Review and merge completed branch PRs** [main] (High Priority)
  - Search for completed, non-draft PRs from work streams
  - Review them, facilitate approval by reviewers or admin
  - Merge approved PR using proper signed merge commit
  - Archive work stream context to Archived Work Streams section
  - Record major accomplishments in README.md
  - Delete branch after successful merge and archiving

- **Update task tracking** [main] (Medium Priority)
  - Cherry-pick in-progress work stream task markers from work streams to main
  - Ensure all in-progress work is properly documented
